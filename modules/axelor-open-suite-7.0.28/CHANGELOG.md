UPDATE account_invoice_payment payment SET reconcile = (
	SELECT MIN(reconcile.id) FROM account_reconcile reconcile 
	INNER JOIN account_invoice_term_payment itp ON itp.invoice_payment = payment.id 
	INNER JOIN account_invoice_term it ON it.id = itp.invoice_term
	INNER JOIN account_move_line ml ON ml.id = it.move_line
